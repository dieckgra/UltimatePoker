# UltimatePoker
A java game consisting of 4 popular pokers games to include Black Jack, Texas Hold'em, 5 Card Draw, and 7 Card Stud!

#DIRECTIONS:

The game will first launch a text based program in the terminal window.  Some of the text based games may have broken while the GUIs were made and the framework (code that did the text-based games) for the GUI were modified so that the GUI would work as it is the priority. Type 5 and just go ahead and launch the GUI from there (a future version will separate the text-based games from the GUI completely).  

The GUI may take a few moments to launch as quite a few images are being drawn (mostly off screen so you won't see it all).  Once it launches you have the option to go to settings, quit, or go to 4 different games.  Don't bother with Texas Hold'em and Seven Card Stud... They are not available yet, but are coming soon!

I recommend first going to settings.  There you can toggle some cool guitar music for the background if you wish, change the background of face down cards, and toggle other game sounds.  You can also click rules which will essentially display all the game rules in the terminal so you will have to navigate back to the terminal and type 0 then press enter when you are done with the instructions to get the GUI back up.  

Once you've read up on the games and/or changed the settings to your liking, click back and navigate to either black jack or 5 card draw.  Both games are popular and fun poker games.  Black jack is easier to play.  There will be a hit and a stay button.  Use those as you would expect.  You can hit until you bust.  You can stand at any time.  After you have either gotten black jack, busted or pressed stand, those buttons will disappear and the dealer will take his turn if you haven't already won.  If you get 7 cards without busting, that is an automatic win called "7 card Charlie".  A play again button will appear near the top next to the back button if you want to go again.

5 Card Draw is not too much harder.  You will be dealt 5 cards and then get 1 opportunity to swap out cards in your hand for the next in the deck.  Click the cards you wish to discard and then once you have selected the cards you want, press discard to discard those cards and redraw until you have 5 again.  I allow you to discard all your cards if you want or none of them.  You may "deselect" a card if you did not mean to click it by clicking again.  However, once you have pressed the discard button, it will be too late to make changes.  The following buttons will simply end your turn, then take you through the dealer's process, and finally display who won.  You will have the option to play again if you wish.  If not, you can always go back to the menu or quit the game by pressing the back button (top left) or quit button (top right) respectively.  


#CREDIT, VERSION NOTES, ETC:

We are currently in version 1 (essentially, it looks like it is under construction and only half the games are available).  You can still play Five Card Draw, and possibly Black Jack if my team mates actually finish it in time... (let's find out if they actually read this and are paying attention.  Jordan and Liam, if either of you are reading this, send me a text and and let me know.)

If you are hoping to play Seven Card Stud and/or Texas Hold'em, you will have to wait till 2020 when I have the time to make them.

I (Douglas Dieckgraefe) built pretty much everything.  I built the framework for the whole program (including text-based black jack) allowing everything to originally run in a console or terminal (or cmd window if you are on a Windows OS).  My two teammates then made the menu page and kind of tried to make the settings.  I only slightly had to edit the menu (add functionality to the buttons, etc.), but I had to basically redo and add most of the features in settings.  I built the GUI Five Card Draw game as well.  

Jordan Cooper can receive credit for the Menu class, Liam Tsamous can receive credit for the Setting class, and they can both receive credit for the BlackJackGUI class.  I accept credit for literally everything else.  

If you are someone looking for a fun game to play, I hope you enjoy!  Don't judge too hard, I will be adding more features 2020 like betting pots, multiple players, and more.  

If you are someone who is Java savvy, again, don't judge too hard.  I know the code is messy.  I worked with a couple noobs in this project and I myself am not a pro either.  I will be cleaning up the code in 2020 as I update the program, add the other two games, and add more features.  Look out for version 2 and hopefully you will see the improvement.

I must also give credit to Jason Leigh, the University of Hawaii professor who not only got me started on Java, but also gets credit for the shuffle and text-based dealing functions for a deck of 52 cards (this counts of a portion of the code in the Card class).
